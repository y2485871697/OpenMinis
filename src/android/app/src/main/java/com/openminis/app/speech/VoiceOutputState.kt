/**
 * [T-android-tts-capsule] GLOBAL read-replies (TTS output) state — the single
 * source of truth shared by the composer's "Read replies" pill and the floating
 * speech-player capsule. Port of iOS `VoiceOutputState`
 * (VoiceProviderResolver.swift:66).
 *
 * Three-level model, in lockstep with iOS:
 *  • disabled (!isEnabled)          → no capsule, no TTS.
 *  • muted    (isEnabled && isMuted)→ capsule stays VISIBLE (so the user can
 *                                     un-mute), playback stopped, new reply
 *                                     TTS suppressed.
 *  • active   (isEnabled && !muted) → replies are spoken.
 *
 * Persisted in the same `voice_prefs` file the pill already used, under the
 * SAME "readReplies" key — so the pill, the capsule, and the streaming
 * read-aloud effect can never disagree about whether TTS is on.
