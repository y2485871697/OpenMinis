/**
 * [T-android-provider-tts-readaloud] Read-aloud playback that routes through
 * the resolved Voice OUTPUT selection, falling back to the on-device engine.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * Read-aloud previously constructed a bare [TextToSpeechManager], so it always
 * used the on-device Android engine. The whole provider TTS stack —
 * `VoiceProvider.synthesize()` plus ~723 lines of vendor adapters (MiniMax,
 * Doubao, ElevenLabs, Azure, Gemini, Xunfei, …) — was reachable only from the
 * settings Quick Test sheet, so no provider voice was usable in chat.
 *
 * ## Routing
 * Each utterance asks [com.openminis.app.data.repository.ProviderRepository
 * .resolveVoiceOutputChoice] (added in the P0-1 commit) where to go:
 *  - System choice, no credentials, unsupported vendor, or ANY synthesis
 *    failure → [TextToSpeechManager] (the on-device engine).
 *  - Provider choice → `synthesize()` then play the returned bytes.
 *
 * Fallback is per-utterance and silent by design: a mid-reply network blip
 * degrades to the device voice rather than dropping the sentence.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 * Utterances go through a [Channel] consumed by a single worker coroutine, so
 * sentence N+1 is synthesized/played only after N finishes. Without this,
 * concurrent `synthesize()` calls would return out of order and the reply would
 * be read scrambled. This is the Android stand-in for iOS's
 * `VoiceOutputPlayer` queue (we deliberately do NOT prefetch-ahead yet — that
 * is P1 territory).
 *
 * Text is sanitized via [VoiceTextSanitizer] before either path, so Markdown,
 * URLs and emoji are never pronounced.
 *
 * Not thread-safe beyond the channel; call from the main thread.
