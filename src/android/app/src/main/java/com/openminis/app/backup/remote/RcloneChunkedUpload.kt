/**
 * Uploads a backup package to an rclone remote as ONE file, and reads packages
 * back. Mirrors `src/ios/Agent/Backup/Remote/RcloneChunkedUpload.swift`.
 *
 * ## History: this used to chunk
 *
 * An earlier revision split the package into 8 MiB parts under
 * `.minis-parts/<backupId>/` with a resume journal, because rclone has no
 * cross-process resume for a single file and a killed 300-of-500 MB upload
 * restarts from zero. That bought resumability at a real cost: every package
 * over 8 MiB lived on the server as a directory of anonymous fragments —
 * unusable by hand, dependent on our own reassembly logic on the restore side,
 * and invisible to the iOS restore picker, which lists `.minisbak` files only.
 * A user looking at their NAS saw no backup at all.
 *
 * iOS re-evaluated the trade on 2026-08-16 and decided it the other way; this
 * is the Android side of that change. The server always holds a clean,
 * self-contained `.minisbak` a user can grab with any client, and an
 * interrupted upload simply re-runs. A failure is surfaced per-destination by
 * the caller, so it is visible, not silent.
 *
 * **New uploads never write `.minis-parts` again.** Reading it back is kept as
 * backward compatibility only: packages a previous build already uploaded in
 * fragments must stay restorable (see [listPackages] / [download]).
 *
 * ## What "success" means
 *
 * A transfer only counts once the remote object's SIZE matches the local file.
 * rclone's copyfile returning cleanly is necessary but not sufficient — a
 * backend can acknowledge a truncated write. Size is the strongest check that
 * works everywhere (WebDAV mostly has no server-side hashes, and rclone's own
 * transport already error-checks each request).
 *
 * The upload goes to a `<name>.partial` scratch object first and is renamed
 * only after the size check passes: a half-uploaded file must never be
 * listable under the real package name.
